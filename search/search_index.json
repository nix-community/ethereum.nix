Nix guarantees you don't have to worry about version conflicts, missing dependencies or even what state your OS is in.</li> <li>We aim that every Ethereum application stored in the repository is constructed from its source, including all input dependencies. This approach guarantees the code's reproducibility and trustworthiness. Furthermore, with Nix, expert users can tweak and adjust the build process to any degree of detail as required.</li> <li>We develop custom NixOS modules to streamline operations with applications such as Execution and Consensus clients (including performing backups). Moreover, we aim to introduce further abstractions that simplify everyday tasks, such as running a production grade Liquid Staking deployment or even a local development environment for running consensus clients and execution clients effortlessly without needing Docker or Kubernetes.</li> </ul> <p>This project is developed entirely in Nix Flakes (but it offers compatibility with legacy Nix thanks to <code>flake-compat</code>).</p>"},{"location":"#eager-to-use-ethereumnix","title":"Eager to use Ethereum.nix?","text":"<p> New to Ethereum.nix and Nix?</p> <p> Get started by installing Nix on your system and how to use it with Ethereum.nix  Getting Started  </p> <p> Want to use an application now?</p> <p> See our list of supported applications ready to be used in seconds.
